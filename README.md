# COVID-19 Tracking App
Created by Erin Thomas | EC500: Building Software | Boston University

## Application Summary
COVID-19 Tracker is a multi-platform application (web/iOS) that displays COVID-19 cases across the world in real-time. Cases can be view by country on a map as well as by date. The app also displays a summary of total cases around the world. This app is created using React Native.

## User Stories
* As a public health professional, I want to know how many cases are in specific countries and how the virus is spreading.
* As a citizen, I want to stay informed about how many cases are in my country.
* As a journalist/news reporter, I want access to a reliable source of information about the number of global cases.

## How to Run This Code
1. Fire up your local terminal and type `git clone https://github.com/BUEC500C1/codvid-app-eet1998.git`. 
2. Navigate to the `/covidapp` directory.
3. Type `expo start` to run the app.

* Important: Unfortunately, I am having serious commit issues with Visual Studio, so I was unable to commit all of the app files (even after re-cloning the repository, deleting all files, and starting from scratch). So, I currently only have the App.js file in this repository.
